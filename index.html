While setting up camp, Jake <span class="adverb"></span> dropped one of the tent <span class="noun"></span> in the river. The campground was incredibly <span class="adjective"></span>, with <span class="adjective"></span> views and plenty of <span class="adjective"></span> trails for hiking.

At that, my cheeks grew <span class="adjective"></span> and I couldn’t speak without blushing for the rest of the <span class="noun"></span>.</p>
